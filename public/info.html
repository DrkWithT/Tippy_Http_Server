    <h2>About Server by DrkWithT (GitHub)</h2>
    <p>After writing another static web server in Java, I decided to try Python 3.x for implementing a very minimal HTTP server. This new HTTP server is called "Tippy". Currently this is a toy project made for fun, so it will support only part of RFC 9112.</p>
